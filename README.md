  <br>
</p>
<p>Hicup Privacy Policy</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, The owners of “Hicup” application use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the “Services”). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refers to Hicup, and ‘you’ refers to you, the user of the Services.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>1.1 Privacy Principles</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>We have two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>We don't (and can’t) see your messages &amp; sent data- we use end to end encryption</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>We only store the data that Hicup needs to function as a secure unique messaging service</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>1.2. Terms of Service</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service,</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>2. Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: (1) providing effective and innovative Services to our users; and (2) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>3. What Personal Data We Use</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>3.1. Basic Account Data</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Hicup is a communication service. You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture) to create a Hicup account.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>For someone to contact you on Hicup, he will need the phone number you signed up with.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>We do not publish or publicly display your contact details, They are stored on our servers.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>3.2. Your Phone number &amp; contacts</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>When you sign up to the Hicup application, we store your phone number on our servers, and ask permission to read your contacts.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>When someone has your phone number saved in their contacts and sends you a message, the message will be sent to the account associated with your phone number.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>When you send a message to one of your contacts, that contacts’ phone number is sent to our servers (so we can forward your message to him).</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>3.3. Your Messages</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>3.3.1. Messages</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Hicup uses end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages. We do not store your secret chats on our servers. We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>3.3.2. Media in Secret Chats</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>When you send audio files, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server. This key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient. They can then download and decipher the file. This means that the file is technically on our servers, but it looks like a piece of random binary data to everyone except for you and the recipient. We don’t know what this random data stands for.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>4. Keeping Your Personal Data Safe</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>4.1. End-to-End Encrypted Data</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Your messages, media and files, are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient. Before this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient. While Hicup servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information. In this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>4.2. Retention</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>5. Processing Your Personal Data</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>5.1. Our Services</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Hicup is a cloud service. We will process your data to deliver your message history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>6. Deleting data</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>6.2. Account Self-Destruction</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>By default, if you stop using Hicup and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all pieces of data you store in the cloud.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>7. Google analytics</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>7.1. Data passed on to google</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your app usage to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the people you interact with to help us understand the performance of our app. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you use our application, you agree for us to pass information Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer n about your activity from the application to activity from other sites that use our google services.</p>
